[Fourth and last assignment is given.](../assignments/2014-11-18.md)

Security is probably the most important aspect of any software development.

## Discussion items

During the lecture, we had a discussion about the security aspects of 3rd party packages. In summarise the following points were brought up when considering what should be checked before taking any 3rd party code in use:

* Validate te code, lint
* Check the origin, who made it, is it public and how active, where is it downloaded from, suspicious web site
* `.exe` suffix
* Does it do what it is supposed to
* Does it do something that it is not supposed to do
* Suspicious instructions, such as using `sudo` or giving access to passwords
* Collects information, surveillance traffic
* Amount of downloads

Tools that could help in checking the above criterias:

* plato
* nsp
