Automatic Semicolon Insertation (ASI) is a handy helper found in many browsers,
but it is usually best to be avoided.

When there are more than one developer working on the given code, unified rules should be created. This is about code style.

Historically, different browsers handle JavaScript differently, while in the case of Node.js, it is using just one JavaScript interpreter. Due to these differences many cases that are possible in modern browsers, are not possible in older or othervise limited browsers. This is about code validation.
