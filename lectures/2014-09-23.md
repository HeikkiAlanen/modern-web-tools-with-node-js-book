# Lecture 5. - HTTP, Connect, Express

> Date 23/09/2014

Setting up a minimal HTTP server with `connect` is just a matter of few lines:

```js
var connect = require('connect');
var http = require('http');

var app = connect();

app.use('/', function(req, res){
  res.end('Welcome to Connect!\n');
});

http.createServer(app).listen(6000);
```

Similar approach can be take with `express`:

```js
var express = require('express');

var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Welcome to Express!\n');
});

app.listen(6000);
```
